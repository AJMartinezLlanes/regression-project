# Regression Project
by AJ Martinez

## Plan
 - State project goals
 - State initial questions
 - Acquire data
 - Prepare Data
 - Create Functions
 - Set the data context
 - Answer questions 
 - Establish a baseline
 - Fit models
 - Recomendations
 - Next steps

## Data Dictionary
|Column                                  |Meaning|
|------                                  |--------|

## Steps to reproduce
- Notebooks with code are in this repo 
- acquire.py with functions on how to acquire data
- prepare.py with functions to clean and prepare data
- Notebook with a walkthrough of the findings

## Project Goals
- Construct an ML Regression model that predict propery tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties using attributes of the properties.
- Find the key drivers of property value for single family properties. Some questions that come to mind are: Why do some properties have a much higher value than others when they are located so close to each other? Why are some properties valued so differently from others when they have nearly the same physical attributes but only differ in location? Is having 1 bathroom worse than having 2 bedrooms?
- Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
- Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in prediction these homes' values.

## Project Description
- Prepare a walk through notebook to help managers understand why are customers churning. 
- Find drivers of churns, find solutions and recomendations to lower the churning rate.

## Initial Questions
- How does the tax_value relate to amount of bathrooms? What about bedrooms?
- How does the tax_value relate construction age?
- How does the tax value relate to house size?
- How does the tax value relate to location?

## Deliberables
1. Readme(.md)
2. Final Report(.ipynb)
3. Acquire & Prepare Modules(.py)
4. 1+ non-final notebooks (.ipynb) created while working the project, containing exploration and modeling work
